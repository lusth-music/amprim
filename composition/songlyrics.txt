Why are you here on this dark mountainside?
Why are you walking alone in the light?
Why are you here on this black lonely night?
What are you wanting to find, out of sight?

What do you see, inside of me
that would make you want to be here with me?
What do you see, inside of me
that would make you want to stay here with me?


What are you searching for here in the dark?
What are you seeking with all of your heart?
What are you searching for in this black night?
Who are you wanting to be at your side?

What do you see, inside of me
that would make you want to be here with me?
What do you see, inside of me
that would make you want to stay here with me?


What do you see, inside of me
that would make you want to choose differently?
Who do you see, if it's not me
that would make you want to be lonely?


Who do you know that would call out your name?
Who do you think would share in your blame?
Who do you know that would take on your pain?
Why do you listen to them all the same?

What do you see, inside of me
that would make you want to be here with me?
What do you see, inside of me
that would make you want to stay here with me?
